    <string name="textoada">"Augusta Ada Byron King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron, 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852), now known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer. Today she is mainly recognized for having written the first algorithm to be processed by a machine, Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. During the time she was involved with Babbage's project, she developed the algorithms that would allow the machine to compute the values ​​of mathematical functions, as well as publishing a collection of notes on the analytical engine. For this work, she is considered the first programmer in history. "</string>
    <string name="textoalan">Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912, London – 7 June 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire) was a British mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of modern theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. He is widely considered the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Despite these accomplishments he was never fully recognized in his home country during his lifetime for being homosexual and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.</string>
